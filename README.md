Assignment 02 in R AKA "Machine Problem"

Choose 5 Problems as required:
1. Define an R function that removes NA values from a vector.
2. Define an R function that computes the factorial of given an integer argument. The output should be a vector of length 1.
3. Define an R function that computes the determinant of a given matrix. The output should be a vector of length 1.
4. Define an R function that sorts a given vector in decreasing order. The output should be a vector of the same length. It should accept both numeric or character vectors.
5. Define an R function that accepts a Date (POSIXct) as argument and outputs the day of the week as characters. Use modulo operator.
6. Create a function to compute for your net pay at work.
7. Create a function that accepts a vector and and integer n and returns nth highest number
8. Create a function that computes the compound interest of an investment given the rate, time, and initial amount or principal.
9. Create a function isPrime(n) that accepts an integer and outputs a Boolean value (TRUE or FALSE) depending whether the integer is a prime number or not.
